         * Improved exception catching in the ASSERT_* macros

         * Added string comparisons
           - regex for matching regular expressions
           - collate for locale dependent sort order

         * Added floating point comparisons
           - abs_diff for values near 0
           - relative_diff for large values

         * Code and documentation cleaning

2009-03-18 0.5.1

         * Fixed test case termination bug which caused gcov to
           malfunction

2009-03-15 0.5.0

         * Added ASSERT_PRED macro, which accepts as predicate
           anything that looks like a function returning a value
           usable as a boolean expression. Predicates can
           optionally define an output stream operator, which
           will be used in violation logs, if available.

         * Added a mechanism to send parameters to the test cases
           through the -p command line switch, and the get_parameter()
           family of static functions in test_case_factory.

         * Fixed bug in command line parsing.

2009-03-05 0.4.0

         * Test  cases now have a default real-time timeout of
           2000ms. This gives them a 3000ms run-time before they
           are killed. Change it upwards or downwards per test-
           case as required.

         * Updated the documentation on how to link when using
           crpcut with google-mock. The earlier described method
           no longer works.

         * Added a get_start_dir() function to test_case_factory,
           which can be used to query the working dir the test-program
           was started in. Since each test case runs in its own
           working dir, this information is otherwise lost once
           the test case creation has begun.

         * Changed the termination tag to violation, and added
           the attribute "phase" which may have either of the
           values "creating", "running", "destroying" and
           "post_mortem" which should make error pinpointing
           a bit easier.

         * Default stdout to human readable format and file output
           to XML. Added -x flag to invert.

         * A number of lib names are now chained when looking
           for a symbol to wrap. Please see the documentation for
           details.

         * No longer exposes the crpcut::wrapped functions - it was
           a major mistake. crpcut itself still wrapps all functions
           it needs in namespace crpcut::wrapped. For your test-
           cases, you wrap the functions you need in whatever
           namespace you please. Sorry for the inconvenience.

         * Sourceforge now hosts the GIT repo as well.
           git://crpcut.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crpcut

         * Fixed a number of bugs

2009-02-16 0.3.0

         * No XML output when running tests with -c 0 for debugging.

         * Improved documentation and source-level enforcement on
           how to link when using google-mock.

         * Use libc/librt functions from dlopen()/dlsym(), and wrap
           them in namespace crpcut.

         * Added macros for creating own function wrappers.

         * Output unstreamable expressions as hex dumps.

2009-02-08 0.2.0

         * Optional support for google-mock. See README_GOOGLE_MOCK for
           details.

         * Added INFO and FAIL output streamers from test cases.

           INFO << expr1 << expr2 << expr3

           Sends the streamed output to the result log, but does not
           change the state of the test.

           FAIL << exp1 << expr2 << expr3

           Immediately terminates the test case as failed, with the
           output streamed data as the error cause.

         * A number of new command line flags:

           -d flag for selecting named working directory

           -o flag to direct XML output to a named file

           -q flag for silencing summation print when -o is used

           Use -n flag instead of -d for nodeps

         * Fixed numerous problems with out-of-tree builds.

         * Improved selftest.
