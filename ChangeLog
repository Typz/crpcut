         * Default stdout to human readable format and file output
           to XML. Added -x flag to invert.

         * No longer exposes the crpcut::wrapped functions - it was
           a major mistake. crpcut itself still wrapps all functions
           it needs in namespace crpcut::wrapped. For your test-
           cases, you wrap the functions you need in whatever
           namespace you please. Sorry for the inconvenience.

2009-02-16 0.3.0

         * No XML output when running tests with -c 0 for debugging.

         * Improved documentation and source-level enforcement on
           how to link when using google-mock.

         * Use libc/librt functions from dlopen()/dlsym(), and wrap
           them in namespace crpcut.

         * Added macros for creating own function wrappers.

         * Output unstreamable expressions as hex dumps.

2009-02-08 0.2.0

         * Optional support for google-mock. See README_GOOGLE_MOCK for
           details.

         * Added INFO and FAIL output streamers from test cases.

           INFO << expr1 << expr2 << expr3

           Sends the streamed output to the result log, but does not
           change the state of the test.

           FAIL << exp1 << expr2 << expr3

           Immediately terminates the test case as failed, with the
           output streamed data as the error cause.

         * A number of new command line flags:

           -d flag for selecting named working directory

           -o flag to direct XML output to a named file

           -q flag for silencing summation print when -o is used

           Use -n flag instead of -d for nodeps

         * Fixed numerous problems with out-of-tree builds.

         * Improved selftest.
