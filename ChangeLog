         * Output unstreamable expressions as hex dumps

2009-02-08 0.2.0

         * Optional support for google-mock. See README_GOOGLE_MOCK for
	   details.

         * Added INFO and FAIL output streamers from test cases.

           INFO << expr1 << expr2 << expr3

           Sends the streamed output to the result log, but does not
	   change the state of the test.

           FAIL << exp1 << expr2 << expr3

           Immediately terminates the test case as failed, with the
	   output streamed data as the error cause.

         * A number of new command line flags:

	   -d flag for selecting named working directory

	   -o flag to direct XML output to a named file

           -q flag for silencing summation print when -o is used

           Use -n flag instead of -d for nodeps

         * Fixed numerous problems with out-of-tree builds

         * Improved selftest.
