2009-11-04 0.8.1 (a.k.a. 1.0-beta-2)

         * Delayed hooking with Google test reporter until test case starts,
           which avoids a spurious SIGSEGV at exit in some circumstances.

         * Fixed bug in calloc(), which wrote to NULL when memory allocation
           failed.

         * Fixed error reporting when heap-failures were discovered outside
           of test cases.

2009-11-01 0.8.0 (a.k.a. 1.0-beta-1)

         * crpcut has entered Beta stage!

         * Google-mock support is now official instead of a dirty hack.
           Only google-mock 1.4.0 and later is supported. The support lib
           libcrpcut-gmock.so no longer exists. The CMake option
           -DWITH_GOOGLE_MOCK=yes now only controls whether google-mock
           tests shall be included in selftest. It is otherwise not needed.

         * Added heap-management, through which you can query the heap
           for allated objects and allocated bytes. You can also limit
           the available heap to test out-of-memory situations. The crpcut
           heap instruments valgrind (http://valgrind.org) if available,
           to aid search for memory leaks.

         * Build support is simplified. crpcut detects the compiler used,
           and adapts at compile time. It is no longer necessary to add
           flags like -Ddecltype=typeof or -std=c++0x.

         * Support for Intel C++ compiler ICC
           http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers/

         * Improved readability on the test result reports. Unfortunately
           this includes a slight change to the XML-schema for XML-output.
           See crpcut.xsd.

2009-10-19 0.7.3

         * Added support for google-mock 1.4.0

2009-10-15 0.7.2

         * Small bugfixes and reduced memory footprint

2009-10-11 0.7.0

         * Added support for tests to have dependencies to testsuites, and
           for testsuites to have dependencies to tests and other testsuites.

         * Added support for ULPS difference tests for floating point values.

         * Changed command line support for single tests in the main process
           for debugging.

           Use "-s testname" (for single shot) instead of "-c 0 -n" to run
           a single test case in the main process.

         * Fixed comparison between pointers and 0 in ASSERT macros.

         * Fixed comparison between pointers to members and 0 in ASSERT macros.

         * Fixed support for static const integer/enum members in ASSERT macros
           without forcing instantiation.

         * Fixed support for non-copyable types in ASSERT macros.

         * Fixed support for stream manipulatiors in INFO/FAIL stream macros.

         * Fixed a bug in the heap of test cases violating their maximum allowed
           time.


2009-04-06 0.6.2

         * Fixed ASSERT_* for non copyable objects

         * Fixed ASSERT_EQ for pointer values

         * Fixed hex dump formatting

         * Fixed printing of pointer values

         * Fixed 2728096 - Support test programs compiled with
           -fno-exceptions with gcc. No-exception support with other
           compilers is still lacking.

         * Fixed numerous warnings (some were real bugs)

         * Fixed include path bug

         * Added -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={release,debug,maint}

         * Much improved CMakeLists.txt making use of --std=c++0x
           if available

         * Moved match_traits<> out of namespace crpcut::datatypes
           to namespace crpcut. Sorry for the inconvenience.

2009-03-31 0.6.1

         * Added missing includes to crpcut.hpp

2009-03-31 0.6.0

         * Fixed broken wrapping of select()

         * Improved exception catching in the ASSERT_* macros

         * Changed the make system such that the test program is not
           built by default

         * Added string comparisons
           - regex for matching regular expressions
           - collate for locale dependent sort order

         * Added floating point comparisons
           - abs_diff for values near 0
           - relative_diff for large values

         * Code and documentation cleaning

2009-03-18 0.5.1

         * Fixed test case termination bug which caused gcov to
           malfunction

2009-03-15 0.5.0

         * Added ASSERT_PRED macro, which accepts as predicate
           anything that looks like a function returning a value
           usable as a boolean expression. Predicates can
           optionally define an output stream operator, which
           will be used in violation logs, if available.

         * Added a mechanism to send parameters to the test cases
           through the -p command line switch, and the get_parameter()
           family of static functions in test_case_factory.

         * Fixed bug in command line parsing.

2009-03-05 0.4.0

         * Test  cases now have a default real-time timeout of
           2000ms. This gives them a 3000ms run-time before they
           are killed. Change it upwards or downwards per test-
           case as required.

         * Updated the documentation on how to link when using
           crpcut with google-mock. The earlier described method
           no longer works.

         * Added a get_start_dir() function to test_case_factory,
           which can be used to query the working dir the test-program
           was started in. Since each test case runs in its own
           working dir, this information is otherwise lost once
           the test case creation has begun.

         * Changed the termination tag to violation, and added
           the attribute "phase" which may have either of the
           values "creating", "running", "destroying" and
           "post_mortem" which should make error pinpointing
           a bit easier.

         * Default stdout to human readable format and file output
           to XML. Added -x flag to invert.

         * A number of lib names are now chained when looking
           for a symbol to wrap. Please see the documentation for
           details.

         * No longer exposes the crpcut::wrapped functions - it was
           a major mistake. crpcut itself still wrapps all functions
           it needs in namespace crpcut::wrapped. For your test-
           cases, you wrap the functions you need in whatever
           namespace you please. Sorry for the inconvenience.

         * Sourceforge now hosts the GIT repo as well.
           git://crpcut.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/crpcut

         * Fixed a number of bugs

2009-02-16 0.3.0

         * No XML output when running tests with -c 0 for debugging.

         * Improved documentation and source-level enforcement on
           how to link when using google-mock.

         * Use libc/librt functions from dlopen()/dlsym(), and wrap
           them in namespace crpcut.

         * Added macros for creating own function wrappers.

         * Output unstreamable expressions as hex dumps.

2009-02-08 0.2.0

         * Optional support for google-mock. See README_GOOGLE_MOCK for
           details.

         * Added INFO and FAIL output streamers from test cases.

           INFO << expr1 << expr2 << expr3

           Sends the streamed output to the result log, but does not
           change the state of the test.

           FAIL << exp1 << expr2 << expr3

           Immediately terminates the test case as failed, with the
           output streamed data as the error cause.

         * A number of new command line flags:

           -d flag for selecting named working directory

           -o flag to direct XML output to a named file

           -q flag for silencing summation print when -o is used

           Use -n flag instead of -d for nodeps

         * Fixed numerous problems with out-of-tree builds.

         * Improved selftest.
