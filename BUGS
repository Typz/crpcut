ULPS tests are not available for long double

ULPS tests are only verified on x86, and thus most probably not correct
for other architectures. Most notably it will not even compile if
sizeof(float) and sizeof(double) is not the same as sizeof(uint32_t) and
sizeof(uint64_t). Should the byte order be different for FP numbers and
integers, it will fail horrenduously.
