Crpcut html display
===================

Display the xml-output from crpcut in your browser. Requires a simple
webserver that can serve the xml-files, but no server-side code.

Note that even though all the html is generated by your web-browser,
it is in most browsers not possible to load the xml-files from
file://-urls, since the security-model of most browsers do not permit
javascript to dynamically load files from file:// urls. All files must
for the same reason be on the same webserver.

Instructions
============

1. Place the crpcut.{html,js,css}-files somewhere on a
   web-server. E.g. http://example.com/crpcut/crpcut.html

2. Place the xml-files generated on the same
   webserver. E.g. http://example.com/xml/result.xml

3. In a modern web-browser, open the url 
   http://example.com/crpcut/crpcut.html?/xml/result.xml
