Requirements
============

A modern C++ compiler (g++ 4.1 or later works) that supports:

* C99 variadic macros
* C99 _Exit() function
* typeof or prefereably c++0x decltype
* tr1 includes (available from http://www.boost.org if your compiler doesn't
  ship with it)

xsltproc (http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html) if you want to build
documentation. html-documentation for the latest releas can always be found
on http://crpcut.sourceforge.net


Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) if you want to run a selftest



Build
=====

1. 'cd' to the directory containing the unpacked crpcut files and type
   'cmake .', or if you want to control the installation directory,
   type 'cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<desired install directory>'.

2. Type 'make'

3. If you have Ruby, and you want to check that crpcut works, type
   'make selftest'. The self test takes about 30 seconds to complete.



Install
=======

1. Type 'make install'.

2. The file 'install_manifest.txt' lists the full path to all installed files.
