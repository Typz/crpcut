The google-mock support is highly experimental. To build you must have an
installed google-mock somewhere. When running cmake, add -DGMOCK_DIR=<path>.
The path shall be to the same as the path given as --prefix=<path> when
running ./configure on google-test. Look into test-src/gmock.cpp to see
how it can be used (and also the full extent of the tests made so far.)

There's an important difference when running gmock under crpcut compared
to running under gtest. crpcut is very heavy-handed. Violations are greeted
with immediate termination.
